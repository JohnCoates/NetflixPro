## History
####I wrote a small article about my experience writing this extension:  [How I learned to write a Chrome Extension in 5 hours, by using the Bruce Lee technique](https://medium.com/@punksomething/how-i-learned-to-write-a-chrome-extension-in-5-hours-by-using-the-bruce-lee-technique-c72911ac7d86)

## Features
* **Quick Rewind:** Button that shows up next to the play/pause button. By default it rewinds 10 seconds, but in the extension settings this can be changed to rewind 30 seconds.
